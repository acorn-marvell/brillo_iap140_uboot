/* Algorithms that can be used in the Brillo boot image for
 * verification. An algorithm consists of a hash type and a signature
 * type.
 *
 * The data used to calculate the hash is the four blocks mentioned in
 * the documentation for |BvbBootImageHeader| except for the data in
 * the "Authentication data" block.
 *
 * For signatures with RSA keys, PKCS v1.5 padding is used. The public
 * key data is stored in the auxilary data block, see
 * |BvbRSAPublicKeyHeader| for the serialization format.
 *
 * Each algorithm type is described below:
 *
 * BVB_ALGORITHM_TYPE_NONE: There is no hash, no signature of the
 * data, and no public key. The data cannot be verified. The fields
 * |hash_size|, |signature_size|, and |public_key_size| must be zero.
 *
 * BVB_ALGORITHM_TYPE_SHA256_RSA2048: The hash function used is
 * SHA-256, resulting in 32 bytes of hash digest data. This hash is
 * signed with a 2048-bit RSA key. The field |hash_size| must be 32,
 * |signature_size| must be 256, and the public key data must have
 * |key_num_bits| set to 2048.
 *
 * BVB_ALGORITHM_TYPE_SHA256_RSA4096: Like above, but only with
 * a 4096-bit RSA key and |signature_size| set to 512.
 *
 * BVB_ALGORITHM_TYPE_SHA256_RSA8192: Like above, but only with
 * a 8192-bit RSA key and |signature_size| set to 1024.
 *
 * BVB_ALGORITHM_TYPE_SHA512_RSA2048: The hash function used is
 * SHA-512, resulting in 64 bytes of hash digest data. This hash is
 * signed with a 2048-bit RSA key. The field |hash_size| must be 64,
 * |signature_size| must be 256, and the public key data must have
 * |key_num_bits| set to 2048.
 *
 * BVB_ALGORITHM_TYPE_SHA512_RSA4096: Like above, but only with
 * a 4096-bit RSA key and |signature_size| set to 512.
 *
 * BVB_ALGORITHM_TYPE_SHA512_RSA8192: Like above, but only with
 * a 8192-bit RSA key and |signature_size| set to 1024.

/* The header for a serialized RSA public key.
 *
 * The size of the key is given by |key_num_bits|, for example 2048
 * for a RSA-2048 key. By definition, a RSA public key is the pair (n,
 * e) where |n| is the modulus (which can be represented in
 * |key_num_bits| bits) and |e| is the public exponent. The exponent
 * is not stored since it's assumed to always be 65537.
 *
 * To optimize verification, the key block includes two precomputed
 * values, |n0inv| (fits in 32 bits) and |rr| and can always be
 * represented in |key_num_bits|.

 * The value |n0inv| is the value -1/n[0] (mod 2^32). The value |rr|
 * is (2^key_num_bits)^2 (mod n).
 *
 * Following this header is |key_num_bits| bits of |n|, then
 * |key_num_bits| bits of |rr|. Both values are stored with most
 * significant bit first. Each serialized number takes up
 * |key_num_bits|/8 bytes.
 *
 * All fields in this struct are stored in network byte order when
 * serialized.  To generate a copy with fields swapped to native byte
 * order, use the function bvb_rsa_public_key_header_to_host_byte_order().
 *
 * The bvb_RSAVerify() function expects a key in this serialized
 * format.
 *
 * The 'bvbtool extract_public_key' command can be used to generate a
 * serialized RSA public key.

/* Binary format for header of the boot image used in Brillo.
 *
 * The Brillo boot image consists of four blocks:
 *
 *  +-----------------------------------------+
 *  | Header data - fixed size                |
 *  +-----------------------------------------+
 *  | Authentication data - variable size     |
 *  +-----------------------------------------+
 *  | Auxilary data - variable size           |
 *  +-----------------------------------------+
 *  | Payload data - variable size            |
 *  +-----------------------------------------+
 *
 * The "Header data" block is described by this struct and is always
 * |BVB_BOOT_IMAGE_HEADER_SIZE| bytes long.
 *
 * The "Authentication data" block is |authentication_data_block_size|
 * bytes long and contains the hash and signature used to authenticate
 * the boot image. The type of the hash and signature is defined by
 * the |algorithm_type| field.
 *
 * The "Auxilary data" is |auxilary_data_block_size| bytes long and
 * contains the auxilary data including the public key used to make
 * the signature and properties.
 *
 * The public key is at offset |public_key_offset| with size
 * |public_key_size| in this block. The size of the public key data is
 * defined by the |algorithm_type| field. The format of the public key
 * data is described in the |BvbRSAPublicKeyHeader| struct.
 *
 * The properties starts at |properties_offset| from the beginning of
 * the "Auxliary Data" block and take up |properties_size| bytes. Each
 * property is stored as |BvbPropertyHeader| with key, NUL, value,
 * NUL, and padding following. The number of properties can be
 * determined by walking this data until |properties_size| is
 * exhausted.
 *
 * The "Payload data" block is |payload_data_block_size| bytes
 * long. This is where the kernel, initramfs, and other data is
 * stored.
 *
 * The size of each of the "Authentication data" and "Auxilary data"
 * blocks must be divisible by 64. This is to ensure proper alignment.
 *
 * Properties are free-form key/value pairs stored in a part of the
 * boot partition subject to the same integrity checks as the rest of
 * the boot partition. See the documentation for |BvbPropertyHeader|
 * for well-known properties. See bvb_property_lookup() and
 * bvb_property_lookup_uint64() for convenience functions to look up
 * property values.
 *
 * This struct is versioned, see the |header_version_major| and
 * |header_version_minor| fields. Compatibility is guaranteed only
 * within the same major version.
 *
 * All fields are stored in network byte order when serialized. To
 * generate a copy with fields swapped to native byte order, use the
 * function bvb_boot_image_header_to_host_byte_order().
 *
 * Before reading and/or using any of this data, you MUST verify it
 * using bvb_verify_boot_image() and reject it unless it's signed by a
 * known good public key.
